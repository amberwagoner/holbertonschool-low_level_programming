# 0x05.C - Pointers, arrays, and strings!

## Learning Objectives

**What are pointers, and how do you use them?**

**What are arrays, and how do you use them?**

**What are the differences between pointers and arrays?**

**How do you use strings, and how do you manipulate them?**

**What are the scope of variables?**


## Tasks

### 0.98 Battery Street
Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`. Use the prototype `void reset_to_98(int *n)`.

### 1.Don't swap horses...
Write a function that swapa the values of two integers. Use the prototype `void swap_int(int *a, int *b)`.

### 2.This report...
Write a function that returns the length of a string. Use the prototype `int _strlen(char *s)`.

### 3.I do not fear computers...
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`. Use the prototype `void _puts(char *s)`.

### 4.I can only go one way...
Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. Use the prototype `void print_rev(char *s)`.

### 5.A good engineer...
Write a function that reverses a string. Use the prototype `void rev_string(char *s)`.

### 6.Half the lies...
Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. Use the prototype `void puts2(char *str)`.

### 7.Winning is only half...
Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. Use the prototype `void puts_half(char *str)`.
- The function should print the second half of the string.
- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last `n` chracters of the string, where `n = (length_of_the_string -1) / 2`.

### 8.Arrays are not pointers
Write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Use the prototype `void print_array(int *a, int n)`.
- `n` is the number of elements of the array to be printed.
- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space.
- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.
- `printf` is allowed.

### 9.strcpy
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte `(\0)`, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. Use the prototype `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src)`.
