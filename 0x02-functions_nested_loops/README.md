# 0x02.C - Functions, nested loops

## Learning objectives

**What are nested loops and how do you use them?**
- It's a loop inside a loop!
- Loops do not need to be nested inside a loop of the same type!
- Syntax will look slightly different depending on the loop type

**What is a function and how do you use them?**
- A function is a group of statements that perform a task.
- Can be helpful to automate certain repetitive statements in your code.
- Debugging code can be easier when using functions (errors are more easily tracable).
- main() is a function

**What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function?**
- Delaration: the return type, function name, and parameters
- Definition: function body

**What is a prototype?**
- It declares the data type, arguments, and parameter list of a function.
- Must be declared before calling the function!

**What is the scope of variables?**
- Scope of a variable is its lifetime in the program.
- Local: declared inside a function or block, not known outside that function
- Global: defined outside a function, usually on top of the program
- Formal: in the definition of function parameters

**What do the following `gcc` flags mean?**
-      `-Wall`  Recommended compiler warnings 
-    `-Wextra`  Enables addition set of flags not covered by -Wall
-    `-Werror`  Causes all enabled warnings to cause compilation errors
-  `-pedantic`  Correct small errors?
- `-std=gnu89`  Correct to GNU version 89?

**What are header files? How do you use them with #include?**
- These contain common C function declarations and macro definitions
- #include acts a request to use the .h file
